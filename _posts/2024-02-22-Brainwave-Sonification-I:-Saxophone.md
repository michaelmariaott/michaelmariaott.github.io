At the [Intelligent Instruments Lab](https://iil.is/), I developed an augmentation for baritone saxophone that sonifies EEG data in realtime. The data recorded using a consumer-grade EEG headband, is translated into audible sounds and the strength of brain activity in different frequency bands, such as alpha, beta, delta, and theta, are mapped to specific audio parameters. This allows the representation of an individual's mental state to influence the sound of their instrument.
